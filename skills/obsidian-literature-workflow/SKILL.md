description: Use this skill when the user keeps paper notes inside an Obsidian project knowledge base and wants filesystem-first literature review, explicit agent-first ingestion, `Papers/` plus `Knowledge/` synthesis, collection-wide normalization, and a default literature canvas without Obsidian MCP.

# Obsidian Literature Workflow

Handle the **literature sub-workflow** inside the filesystem-first Obsidian project knowledge base.

## Role in the workflow

This is a **supporting skill** under `obsidian-project-memory`.

Use it when the user says things like:
- “My papers are in Obsidian”
- “Import papers from external sources and create notes in the vault”
- “Review the notes under `Papers/`”
- “Generate literature knowledge notes from this project vault”
- “Connect paper notes to project knowledge”
- “Show me the literature structure as a map/graph”
- “Check whether all papers already have detailed notes”

## Assumptions

- The project is already bound through `.claude/project-memory/registry.yaml`, or can be imported with `obsidian-project-bootstrap`
- Durable paper notes live under `Papers/` inside `Research/{project-slug}/`
- Obsidian note writing is done through the filesystem; no Obsidian MCP is required
- External sources (arXiv, DOI, local-websearch, etc.) are used to discover and import papers

## Default workflow

1. Read bound project memory and locate the vault root.
2. If source papers are from external tools, import them into the vault first using literature search tools.
3. Scan `Papers/` and adjacent synthesis notes using filesystem tools.
4. Normalize note metadata and structure using `$obsidian-markdown`.
   - Prefer the standardized review schema:
     - `Claim`
     - `Method`
     - `Evidence`
     - `Limitation`
     - `Direct relevance to repo`
     - `Relation to other papers`
5. Query narrowly first:
   - read the relevant paper notes,
   - then the linked `Knowledge/` notes,
   - and only then open `Writing/` if the user asked for a review or comparison deliverable.
6. Prefer updating existing paper notes and literature synthesis notes over creating sibling notes.
7. Default literature synthesis should land in `Knowledge/`, not `Experiments/` or `Results/`:
   - update `Knowledge/Literature-Overview.md`
   - update `Knowledge/Method-Families.md`
   - update `Knowledge/Research-Gaps.md`
   when the synthesis is stable enough to deserve canonical notes.
8. If the source is a named collection and the user cares about completeness, maintain a collection inventory note with explicit coverage mapping.
9. Refresh `Maps/literature.canvas` after major paper-note changes or batch note creation.
   - Prefer argument-map structure over dense all-to-all links.
   - Prefer semantic filtering and edge thinning.
   - Create `Maps/literature-main.canvas` only when a lightweight presentation graph is needed.
10. Update the daily note and project memory with what changed.

## Default outputs

- `Papers/` remains first-class: one durable paper note per paper whenever possible
- `Knowledge/` holds durable literature synthesis notes
- `Maps/literature.canvas` is the default visual graph surface
- literature work should usually produce at least one of:
  - new or updated paper notes,
  - new or updated knowledge notes,
  - literature-canvas refresh,
  - optional writing synthesis when requested

## Default stance

Do **not** assume by default:
- `Concepts/`
- `Datasets/`
- `.base` views

The literature workflow may create `Maps/literature.canvas` by default. Other artifacts still require explicit justification.

## References

Load only what is needed:
- `references/PAPER-NOTE-SCHEMA.md` - detailed paper-note frontmatter and sections
- `references/CANVAS-WORKFLOW.md` - how and when to refresh `Maps/literature.canvas`
