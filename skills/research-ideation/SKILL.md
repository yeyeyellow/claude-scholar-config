name: Research Ideation
description: This skill should be used when the user asks to "brainstorm research ideas", "use 5W1H framework", "identify research gaps", "conduct gap analysis", "start research project", "conduct literature review", "define research question", "select research method", "plan research", or mentions research project initiation phase. Provides comprehensive guidance for research startup workflow from idea generation to planning.

# Research Ideation

Supports the complete workflow for the research project initiation phase, from literature review to research question definition, method selection, and research planning.

## Core Features

### 1. Idea Brainstorming (5W1H Framework)

Systematically brainstorm research ideas using the 5W1H framework:
- **What**: What problem or phenomenon to study
- **Why**: Why this problem is important
- **Who**: Target audience and stakeholders
- **When**: Time scope and context of the research
- **Where**: Application scenarios and domains
- **How**: Preliminary research methodology ideas

**Integration with superpowers:brainstorming**: Can invoke the superpowers:brainstorming skill for interactive brainstorming to help rapidly generate and evaluate research ideas.

### 2. Literature Review

Systematically search, analyze, and synthesize related literature:
- Build effective search keywords
- Search via local-websearch (zero MCP quota) across academic databases (arXiv, Semantic Scholar, OpenAlex, Crossref)
- Screen and evaluate paper quality
- Identify research trends and gaps
- Generate structured literature reviews
- **Obsidian Integration**: Create paper notes as Markdown files with frontmatter, organized in project directories, linked via wikilinks

### 3. Gap Analysis

Systematically identify and evaluate research gaps:
- **Literature gaps**: Identify topics or questions not yet sufficiently studied
- **Methodological gaps**: Discover limitations and improvement opportunities in existing methods
- **Application gaps**: Identify opportunities for theory-to-practice transfer
- **Interdisciplinary gaps**: Discover research opportunities at the intersection of different fields
- **Temporal gaps**: Identify new research needs arising from changes over time

**Analysis Dimensions:**
- Coverage of research topics
- Comparison of strengths and weaknesses of existing methods
- Completeness of experimental setups
- Availability of datasets and benchmarks
- Gap between theory and practice

### 4. Research Question Definition

Formulate specific research questions based on literature analysis:
- Identify research gaps and opportunities
- Apply SMART principles to formulate questions
- Evaluate importance, novelty, and feasibility
- Define research objectives and expected contributions

### 5. Method Selection

Select appropriate research methods:
- Analyze strengths and weaknesses of existing methods
- Evaluate method applicability
- Identify required technologies and resources
- Consider method feasibility

### 6. Research Planning

Develop detailed research plans:
- Plan research timeline
- Define milestones and deliverables
- Identify potential risks
- Assess resource requirements

## When to Use

### Scenarios for This Skill

Use the research-ideation skill in the following situations:

1. **Starting a new research project** - Have research interests but no clear research question yet
2. **Literature review** - Need to systematically understand a research field
3. **Research question formulation** - Need to transform vague ideas into specific research questions
4. **Method selection** - Need to choose appropriate research methods and technical approaches
5. **Research planning** - Need to plan research timeline and resources

### Typical Workflow

```
Research interest → Idea brainstorming (5W1H) → Literature review → Gap analysis → Define question → Select method → Create plan
```

**Output Files:**
- `literature-review.md` - Structured literature review
- `research-proposal.md` - Research proposal (including question, method, plan)
- Obsidian project with Papers/, Knowledge/, Writing/ directories
- Paper notes with frontmatter and wikilinks

## Integration with Other Systems

### Complete Research Workflow

```
research-ideation (Research initiation)
    ↓
Experiment execution (completed by user)
    ↓
results-analysis (Results analysis)
    ↓
ml-paper-writing (Paper writing)
```

### Data Flow

- **research-ideation output** → Guides experiment design and method selection
- **Experimental results** → results-analysis for statistical analysis
- **Analysis results** → Related Work and Methods sections of ml-paper-writing

### Obsidian Integration

Filesystem-first literature management through Obsidian vault:

- **Project Structure**: Create organized directory structure with Papers/, Knowledge/, Maps/, Writing/
- **Paper Notes**: Auto-generated Markdown files with frontmatter (citekey, authors, year, venue, DOI, etc.)
- **Wikilink Network**: Link related papers, methods, and concepts via Obsidian wikilinks
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Create overview, method classification, and research gap notes
- **Search & Query**: Use Obsidian search and Dataview for structured queries
